Facial Expression Recognition
This project implements a facial expression recognition system using deep learning techniques. It leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify facial expressions from images in real time. The model is trained on the FER2013 dataset and can identify various emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and more.

Features
Real-Time Emotion Detection: Detects emotions in live video feed using a webcam.
Model Training: Includes scripts for training the model with the FER2013 dataset.
Performance Visualization: Provides visualization of training metrics, including accuracy and loss over epochs.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for emotion detection and analysis.
